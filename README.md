# Files2Table
File tree to html pages displayed with tables

...at least that's the idea, idk if this will be efficient or pointless, but it sounds good in my head. 

the idea behind this is making a file tree using html tables for a potential archive site. i know there's already stuff for "archive sites" but eh why not make my own.

## Concept Stage: 
this is the concept table i made, guess we'll see where it goes from here \

## Update 0.1: Read Files 
okay readfiles.py can now list files and folders in a directory along with there sizes. a good start i suppose

## Update 0.2: Write/Print/Convert 
okay read files now writes the list of files with their sizes to files.txt. \
it then can read your line of choice and print it to console \
currently working on it reading lines and converting to </td> in preperation for HTML \
